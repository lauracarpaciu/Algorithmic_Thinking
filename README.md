Algorithmic_Thinking_EDA

We often need to update the dataset and prepare the data for analysis.
When working with a large set of data to be processed, there is often a requirement to add, delete, search, filter values and remove duplicates values. 
Also the notion of index is used to find values within a dataset.
The search for the minimum, maximum, nearest zero value is handled and is used in data mining. We also use functions that return the mean and the sum (aggregation functions). 
Situations where we need to sort items can be handled in several ways with the following functions : 'counting sort', quick sort', 'selection sort', 'insertion sort'.
